Hello!

I’m a final-year Computer Science student at Stanford University with a broad interest in the development and responsible application of generative foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs). Lately, I’ve been exploring ways to enable these models to “think” longer or harder when necessary, leveraging inference-time techniques like search, self-refinement, and innovative approaches such as diffusion-based language models.

I’ve had the privilege of working with Prof. Stefano Ermon at Stanford, focusing on efficient inference techniques for LLMs, geospatial tasks, and bias analysis. Previously, I applied my machine learning skills in industry at Meta and Lacework, and I’ve also investigated using LLMs for decision-making in autonomous systems.

If you’re interested in these topics—or just want to say hello—I’d love to hear from you!
