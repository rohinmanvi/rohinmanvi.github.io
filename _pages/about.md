I am an incoming CS PhD student at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/). I am also a researcher at [Liquid AI](https://www.liquid.ai/). Previously, I was a CS undergrad (and part coterm) at Stanford, where I had the opportunity to work with [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/).
